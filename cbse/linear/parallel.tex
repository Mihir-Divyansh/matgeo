	\item Find the Cartesian equation of the line which passes through the point $(-2, 4, -5)$ and is parallel to the line
	\begin{align*}
	\dfrac{x+3}{3} = \dfrac{4-y}{5} = \dfrac{z+8}{6}.
	\end{align*} \hfill (12, 2019)
	\item Find the vector equation of the line passing through $(2, 1, -1)$ and parallel to the line $\overrightarrow{r} = (\hat{i} + \hat{j}) + \lambda (2\hat{i} - \hat{j} + \hat{k})$. Also, find the distance between these two lines. \hfill (12, 2019)
