\item Find the equations of the two lines through the origin which intersect the line $ \dfrac{x-3}{2}=\dfrac{y-3}{1}=\dfrac{z}{1}$ at angles of  $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$each.
	\item
 Two lines passing through the point (2,3) intersect each other at an angle of $60\degree$. If slope of one line is 2, find the equation of the other line.
