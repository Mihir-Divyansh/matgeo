\item $10$ students of Class X took part in a Mathematics quiz. If the number of girls is $4$ more than the number of boys, find the number of boys and girls who took part in the quiz.
\item $5$ pencils and $7$ pens together cost $Rs. 50$ whereas $7$ pencils and $5$ pens together cost $Rs. 46$. Find the cost of one pencil and that of one pen.
\item Half the perimeter of a rectangular garden, whose length is $4m$, more than its width, is $36m$. Find the dimensions of the garden.
\item A part of monthly hostel charges is fixed and the remaining depends on the number of days one has taken food in the mess. When a student $A$ takes food for $20$ days she has to pay Rs.$1000$ as hostel charges whereas a student $B$ who takes food for $26$ days, pays Rs.$1180$ as hostel charges. Find the fixed charges and the cost of food per day.
\item A fraction becomes $\frac{1}{3}$ when $1$ is subtracted from the numerator and it becomes $\frac{1}{4}$ when $8$ is added to the denominator. Find the fraction.
\item Yash scored $40$ marks in a test, getting $3$ marks for each right answer and losing $1$ mark for each wrong answer. Had $4$ marks been awarded for each correct answer and $2$ marks been deducted for each incorrect answer, then Yash would have scored $50$ marks. How many questions were there in the test?
\item Places $A$ and $B$ are $100km$ apart on a highway. One car starts from $A$ and another from $B$ at the same time. If the car travel in the same direction at different speeds, they meet in $5$hrs. If they travel towards each other, they meet in $1$hr. What are the speeds of the two cars?
\item The area of rectangle gets reduced by $9$ square units, if its length is reduced by $5$ units and breadth is increased by $3$ units. If we increase the length by $3$ units and the breadth by $2$ units, the area increases by $67$ square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.
\item Narayan tells his daughter, `Seven years ago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, $3$ years from now, I shall be $3$ times as old as  you will be.' Find their ages. 
\item The coach of a cricket team buys $3$ bats and $6$ balls for $Rs.3900$. Later, she buys another bat and $3$ more balls of the same kind for $Rs.3300$. Find the cost of a bat and ball.
\item The cost of $2kg$ of apples and $1kg$ of grapes on a day was found to be $Rs.160$. After a month, the cost of $4kg$ of apples and $2kg$ of grapes is $Rs.300$. Assuming that the costs remain unchanged, find the cost of a kg of apples and grapes. 
\item A trust fund has \rupee~30000 that must be invested in two different types of bonds. The first bomd pays $5\%$  interest per year, and the secon bond pays $7\%$ interest per year.  Determine how to divide \rupee~30000 among the $2$ types of bonds. If the trust fund must obtain an annual total interest of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \rupee~1800
\item \rupee~2000
\end{enumerate}
\item Draw the graphs of the equations $x-y+1=0$ and $3x+2y-12=0$. Determine the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle formed by these lines and the axis and shade the triangular region.
\end{enumerate}
